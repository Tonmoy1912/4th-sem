Limit Point of a open subset of R

A set A is open iff for every point a∈A, there exists a δ such that the neighborhood (a−δ,a+δ) surrounding a is completely contained within (is a subset of)A.
A point x is a limit point of a set A iff given any ε, all neighborhoods (x−ε,x+ε) intersect the set A in some point other than x
Eg:- Limit points of open set (0,1) is 0 and 1 .

Limit point exists for sets which are infinite and bounded
